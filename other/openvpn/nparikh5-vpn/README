When using the nparikh5_browncs_gateall.ovpn config all network traffic will be encrypted and passed through the VPN tunnel.  This is for when you _do_ _not_ trust the network you're on, like a public wifi hotspot, hotel or from another continent.

When using the nparikh5_browncs.ovpn config only traffic bound for the CS and Brown networks will be passed through the VPN tunnel.  This is for when you _do_ trust the network you're connected to and simply need to connect to internal CS or Brown resources, like the file system or department printers.

If you have any questions or concerns, please email problem@cs.brown.edu.
